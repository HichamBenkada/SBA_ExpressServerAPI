# SBA 318: Express Server Application

## Introduction
Here I have created a Jokes RESTful API as an assessment that measures my understanding of Node and Express and my capability to implement their features in a practical manner

## Objectives
For this project, I developed a _RESTful API_ server application using Node and Express. The implementation incorporates third-party middlewares from Express, employs a template engine for rendering views, and enhances interactivity by integrating a self-made API through HTML forms.
