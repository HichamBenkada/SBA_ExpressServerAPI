# SBA 318: Express Server Application

## Introduction
Here I have created a Jokes RESTful API as an assessment that measures my understanding of Node and Express and my capability to implement their features in a practical manner

## Objectives
For this project, I developed a _RESTful API_ server application using Node and Express. The implementation incorporates third-party middlewares from Express, employs a template engine for rendering views, and enhances interactivity by integrating a self-made API through HTML forms.

## Implementation:

Welcome to Joke Api: Feel free to explore all routes

Home page: 
    - GET /
Access API route: 
    - GET /api
Explore (Read) users: 
    - GET /api/users
Create a user: 
    - POST /api/users
Get user by id: 
        - GET /api/users/:id
Update user by id: 
        - PATCH /api/users/:id
Delete user by id: 
        - DELETE /api/users/:id


Explore (Read) Jokes: 
    - GET /api/jokes
Create a joke: 
    - POST /api/jokes
Read a joke by id: 
        - GET /api/jokes/:id
Update a joke: 
        - PATCH /api/jokes/:id
Delete a joke 
        - DELETE /api/jokes/:id

Thank you for your time. I hope these jokes bring a smile to your face!
